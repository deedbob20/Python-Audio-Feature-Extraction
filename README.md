# Python-Audio-Feature-Extraction
Various Jupyter Notebooks with implementations for extracting a number of different features from an audio file. For analysis, classification etc...

Feature extraction libraries used were Librosa and Essentia.

Note: I haven't made tha audio files which I used publically available, but all the code can be easily edited to work for an audio file(s) of your choosing.
